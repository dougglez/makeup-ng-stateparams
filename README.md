$stateParams mini project.

An angular app has already been set up for you, along with ui-router. Take a look at the app.js file to find that your states have been (mostly) set up for you.

If you run live-server, you should see an array of users.

Your task:

1. When a button is clicked on: <br />
  a. the id of that user will appear in the url as a url parameter <br />
  b. and you should find yourself on the details route <br />

2. When on the details state: <br />
    a. the user's info of the button that was clicked on should be displaying <br />
    b. the user's info that is being displayed should be based on the user id in the url <br />

3. Show your mentor when you are finished.
